# Library Phase Three

This assignment was part of my software development apprenticeship program. It is the third part of a multi-phase project in which I create a full-stack library application.

## Overview
Phase III of the library app has a front-end built with ReactJS, and utilizes a REST API to perform CRUD operations on books stored in a Cloud Firestore database on GCP. This phase builds upon the second phase of the project, in which I used React to build components and manage state. In the third phase of the project, I incorporated Redux to manage some of the application's state, independent of the components. I built action creators, actions, and reducers in order to interact with the REST API and support pagination.  This phase did not require me to interact with the Firestore database directly, as the back-end was already built out. In addition, the HTML and CSS was provided to me as boiler plate code.
